# Air-Quality-Neural-Network
A Science Fair Project where I make a neural network using PyTorch to try and predict Air Quality

Checklist / Plan (9/19)
#1 Figure out what a Neural Network needs to work
#2 How to allow the network to read from files
#3 Give outputs AQI classifications
#4 Allow the program to account for seasonal factors
#5 Adjust duration of the predictions
#6
